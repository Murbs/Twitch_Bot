# Twitch_Bot

This bot was built largely following [this](https://github.com/NinjaBunny9000/DeepThonk) guide, credit all goes to @Ninjabunny9000 and her wonderful blog. The rest is myself fumbling through making fun toys for my friends to play with on their Twitch channels.

*DISCLAIMER: This is a work in progress, and is sloppy as hell.. I PLAN to refactor a lot of things, but it's not a priority at the moment. Sometimes life do be that way :') Always open to suggestions!*
